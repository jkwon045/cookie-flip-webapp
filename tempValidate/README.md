## Usage (Linux, MacOS...?)

`javac Driver.java && java Driver`

The `Driver.class` file this makes is a build file, you can ignore it from the repo.

Add test cases in main. I used [this](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/reversi.html) for testing, which is why I went with red/blue instead of X/O.

I'll port this over to the main JS project once all logic errors are gone. The test case here has some broken edge cases.
